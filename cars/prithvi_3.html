              <b>Competition Experience: BAJA SAE 2012</b><br />
              BAJA ’12 was IIT Bombay Racing’s third year at the national event and this time around, we came in as an
              experienced team, with a buzz around us and a determination to prove ourselves. And boy, we did! After a
              fun journey, the 40 member strong contingent arrived at Pithampur and rushed straight to the Natrip tracks
              to great our beloved car. Prithvi 3.0 had been a special effort. The design reflected our wealth of
              experience, the gruelling three month testing period proved the car’s sturdiness and the shiny new Fox
              shocks and a two way telemetry system provided the “Wow” factor. Once the car was unloaded, it was pushed
              to the pits, thoroughly examined and readied for the next day.<br />
              <x class="car-story-subheading">Day 0</x><br>Day 0 began with the Technical Inspection, which was cleared
              barring a
              few minor hiccups. Importantly, the brakes, which had been a worry for the last two seasons, locked in the
              very first attempt to the delight of the Brakes Team. Our pre event planning and preparation had paid off
              and by afternoon, we were back in the pits. The rest of the day went in checking out the competition, a
              huge learning experience for the junior team.<br />
              <x class="car-story-subheading">Day 1</x><br>Day 1 dawned and after waking up at 5 am, the team was at the
              tracks
              at 7, rushing to get in the line for the static events. The Design Evaluation went like a breeze, fetching
              us two “Very Good” remarks, for our custom designed drive train and the car’s serviceability. The low cost
              data acquisition system was appreciated as well. The judges were especially impressed with the analysis
              done to support the design and our preparedness in answering questions. There was some doubt regarding our
              sleek A-arms, but the Vehicle Dynamics team was confident that they would last the endurance race. The
              research done on exhaust analysis floored the judges. After a great showing, we headed to the weigh in. At
              240 kgs, we were the lightest car to compete at the event confirming one award on Day 1 itself! Next up
              was the acceleration run, where we clocked a respectable 6.98 seconds which placed us second on the pole.
              The day ended on a joyous note. Our overall performance in the static events had put us in the top 5 and
              our car was displayed to the waiting media at the event inauguration!<br />
              <x class="car-story-subheading">Day 2</x><br>Day 2 was spent in completing the rest of the dynamic events.
              The
              hill
              climbs looked challenging and the team waited with a bated breath. But where many of our close competitors
              had faltered, Prithvi 3.0 rampaged through, justifying the testing done on the Sameer Hill at IIT Bombay.
              Next came the manoeuvrability test. We were much better equipped for the event this year round, with a
              smaller turning radius and reverse gear. The results were there to show. Navigating through huge rocks,
              ditches, sharp corners and logs, Prithvi 3.0 blazed through earning the respect of the onlookers. Dynamic
              events cleared, it was now time to run a few practice laps on the endurance track and thoroughly prepare
              the car for the big event the next day.<br>
              <x class="car-story-subheading">Day 3</x><br>Day 3 arrived with a sense of anticipation. The Baja
              Endurance
              Race is
              an experience of a lifetime. You pit a full year of engineering effort against the forces of nature. It is
              like going to a war, you go in boys, you return back as men. Every moment is an adrenaline rush. Wild
              cheering ensued as the cars were flagged off. In the pits, the telemetry team had set base, continuously
              monitoring the car’s speed, RPM and location using wireless communication. Within 8 laps, however we
              realised that our RPM numbers were off and the car was underperforming. Trusting his gut, the captain
              called for an early pitstop and drive train team rushed to the car and quickly corrected the error in the
              throttle cable. In hindsight, the decision proved to be a master-stroke and definitely saved us at least 5
              positions in the final standings. By the end of the race, our throats were hoarse and our hearts were
              glad. We had finished fourth! The event ended with a bagful of awards, for lightest sustainable car, being
              second in the acceleration run, the Ansys CAE award and finally the biggie, the AQ Peers’ Choice Award for
              the best ATV, which we won by a margin of over 25 votes amongst 100 competitors.<br />
              This was indeed our best showing at the event so far. We came back winning the hearts of our competitors,
              the respect of industry engineers and awards and job offers to the boot!
