              After a year long struggle, hours of sleepless nights and lots of ups and down the first car of the IIT
              Bombay racing team – “Vayu” was ready to face the challenge of the Formula SAE Michigan 2008. After its
              long trip half way around the world, both the car and the team where at the Michigan International
              Speedway near Detroit the heart of the American motoring industry. Having arrived 3-4 days before the
              competition the car was carefully unloaded from the crate and reassembled to working condition. The 12 man
              team was ready for a challenge of a lifetime. <br />
              <x class="car-story-subheading">Day 1</x><br> It was a bright and sunny day and not a cloud in the sky.
              There
              was an announcement on the address
              system-“Rain in 6 minutes”. After a quick glance in the sky and concluding the Americans where as rubbish
              at weather prediction as they are at cricket, the team set about setting up the paddock and unloading the
              car, only to get drenched 6 minutes later. The “non-tech” team had gotten us a tent, a surprisingly large
              one and we up for the technical inspection. The rest of day 1 involved queuing, changing form wet weather
              tyres to slicks and then back to wets and then back to slicks. We saw other teams, it was the world finals
              that year in Michigan where the winners of all last year’s different FSAE and FS competition where
              present. We seemed only humble beginners to the colossus of Western Australia, TU Graz, TU Delft, RMIT and
              Michigan State University, but then of course we where. A special mention goes to Prof. Seah Kar Heng of
              NUS who was impressed by our first year effort and shook hands with us stating – “Asia-Asia bhai bhai”
              <br />
              <x class="car-story-subheading">Day 2</x><br> Technical Inspection was first thing in the morning. Within
              10
              mins we had a list of things to do to
              our car in order to compete mostly minor except the impact attenuator which the judges suggested that be
              changed for safety reasons. The other teams present at the competition where very willing to help, with
              some of them even willing to lend us their impact attenuator. However the team was quick to improvise and
              fabricated an impact attenuator quickly using some aluminium honeycomb and epoxy. For the rest of the day
              the hammer, the wrench, the pliers and cable ties where our friends as we prepared for a technical
              inspection again the next morning. <br />
              <x class="car-story-subheading">Day 3</x><br> It was afternoon then we had become the first Indian team to
              pass technical inspection at a Formula
              SAE event in the USA. The day was a very busy one however with all the static events happening almost
              simultaneously. The design event considered most prestigious was up first. The judges at the event where
              highly respected engineers from the automotive industry and the head judge was Mr. Paul Davis, who is one
              of the main engineers at the Daimler. This was followed by the cost event and the marketing presentation.
              Intimidated by the competition all our sentences in the competition started with – “We are a first year
              team from India so... “ Soon we realised thatv the judges where appreciative of our effort and where quite
              friendly. They provided useful criticism and at the same time encouragement. The events of the day
              proceeded smoothly. <br />
              <x class="car-story-subheading">Day 4</x><br> The delays from day 1 had put us in a situation where we
              were
              going to miss the first of the dynamic
              events because we where yet to clear the tilt test, the noise test and the brake test. The tilt test was
              something the team was unsure of as it had not been tested before but the team moved smoothly past the
              test without any leakages or oil spills. The noise test was cleared in the second attempt. However, a
              leaky differential prevented us from the completion of the break test on that day. In the evening the
              entire team spent trying to fix the problem. <br />
              <x class="car-story-subheading">Day 5</x><br> After finally fixing the differential problem and
              reassembling
              the vehicle the car was ready for the
              break test by afternoon. The first 2 attempts at the brake test were not successful the driver had some
              issues shifting fast enough to gain enough speed. After a run in the practice area the test was attempted
              again to finally complete the brake test successfully. Although by then it was too late to compete in the
              dynamics. Although the team was slightly let down we decided to make most of it by bringing the car to the
              judges review so that we could learn more for the future. The judge we were presented was Mr. Doug
              Milliken. His book on vehicle dynamics is bible for FSAE and he is one of the most respected people in the
              paddock at that moment. He sent a good part of 2 hours advising us on improvements we should look for. Set
              some target for our future teams and was an absolute delight to talk to. While he said our effort was
              commendable but we had a long was to go. <br />
              The last day was the award ceremony – IIT Bombay racing Vayu has won the SAE Perseverance award given to
              the top 3 rookie teams of that year. The prize was the set of Carroll Smith Book which would help us
              design better vehicles in the future.
